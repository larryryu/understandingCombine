`.buffer` (Publishers.Buffer) is apparently intended to reconcile the timing between the upstream's production of values and the downstream's demand for those values.
It accumulates values from upstream into its internal buffer, which is of predefined size, until the buffer fills up due to backpressure from downstream. At that point, it throws away values from upstream or throws an error, depending on how you've configured the operator. The buffer itself effectively behaves as a FIFO stack (also known as a queue).

Some examples will clarify, but first let's talk about the parameters:

`size:`
: The size of the buffer.

`prefetch:`
: The strategy (Publishers.PrefetchStrategy) for requesting values from upstream. There are two possibilities (the names do not describe the behavior very well):

  * `.byRequest`, despite the name, means that the operator makes an `.unlimited` demand right at the start.

  * `.keepFull` means that the operator pauses as soon as a value arrives that can't go into the buffer. 
  
`whenFull:`
: The policy to be followed (Publishers.BufferingStrategy) when a value arrives from upstream but the buffer is full. There are three possibilities:

  * `.dropNewest` means throw away the new value that doesn't fit into the buffer. 
  
  * `.dropOldest` means throw away the first value from the buffer and append the new value at the end.
  
  * `.customError` means fail; it takes an associated value that's a function producing an Error, which is sent downstream as a failure.

To make sense of `.buffer`, we need a pipeline that exerts [backpressure](operatorsFlatMap) from below. Here's one:

    let pub = Timer.publish(every: 0.2, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()
        .scan(0) {i,_ in i+1}
        .buffer(size: 4, prefetch: .byRequest, whenFull: .dropNewest)
        .flatMap(maxPublishers:.max(1)) {
            Just($0).delay(for: 2, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
        }

At the top of the pipeline we have a publisher that produces values every one-fifth of a second. At the bottom we have a `.flatMap` with a `.max(1)` demand setting, so that it asks for just one value at a time, while transforming its received value into a publisher with a two-second `.delay`. This means that when a value arrives into the `.flatMap`, it sits there for two seconds before being published, at which point the `.flatMap` requests a new value.

If there were no `.buffer` operator in the story, this pipeline would simply produce one successive Int every two seconds. The backpressure from `.flatMap` applies directly to the publisher at the top: every time the `.flatMap` asks for a new value, the upstream produces the next value in the series. But now we have introduced a buffer between them — and the buffer can hold only four values at a time. What will happen? Here's what we get, one value every two seconds, at the end of the pipeline:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    12
    23
    34
    ...

Here's what happened:

1. The buffer starts by asking for unlimited values, and the `.flatMap` starts by asking for one value. After one-fifth of a second, the first value arrives and the buffer passes it on to the `.flatMap`. The `1` is now sitting in the `.flatMap`, waiting for two seconds to be published, exerting backpressure on the buffer.

2. Meanwhile, values keep arriving into the buffer: the `2`, the `3`, the `4`, the `5`... But now the buffer is full (because it only holds four values), and the `6` arrives. That's an overflow. We have told the buffer to `.dropNewest`, so the `6` is thrown away. And so on for the `7`, the `8`, and all the numbers up to `11`.

3. At that point, `.flatMap` publishes the `1` and asks for a new value. The buffer responds by feeding it the `2`, freeing up a space in the buffer. So when the `12` arrives, there's room for it, and in it goes into the buffer.

4. Now there's no more room in the buffer again, while we wait two seconds for the `.flatMap` to clear, and the `13` arrives and is thrown away, then the `14`, and so on.

5. Eventually we reach a steady state where only every 11th value from the top of pipeline arrives at the bottom; all the others are being thrown away because they encounter a full buffer.

If we change `.dropNewest` to `.dropOldest`, the result is the same except that we achieve the steady state much sooner:

    1
    8
    18
    29
    40
    ...

Here's what happened:

1. As before, the `1` passes into the `.flatMap` and the `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` fill up the buffer.

2. Now our policy is `.dropOldest`, so when the `6` arrives it goes into the buffer and the `2` is thrown away; the `7` arrives and goes into the buffer and the `3` is thrown away; and so on.

3. Eventually the buffer consists of `8`, `9`, `10`, `11` — and at that moment the `1` is finally published from the `.flatMap`, which requests a new value, and is handed the `8` from the start of the buffer. And so on, eventually reaching a steady state where only every 9th value from the top of the pipeline arrives at the bottom.

So much for the `.byRequest` strategy. Now let's illustrate the `.keepFull` strategy. I'll use a completely different example (suggested by Stack Overflow user [New Dev](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63257257/341994)). We have a PassthroughSubject (`self.subject`):

    self.subject
        .flatMap(maxPublishers:.max(1)) {
            Just($0).delay(for: 2, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
        }
        .sink { print($0) }.store(in: &self.storage)
    for i in 1...10 {
        self.subject.send(i)
    }
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) {
        self.subject.send(11)
    }

The output is:

    1 (after two seconds)
    11 (after three more seconds)

While the values `2` through `10` were arriving, the pipeline was blocked by the `.flatMap`, which requests only one value at a time and doesn't request a new value until the two-second `.delay` has passed. So those values fell on deaf ears; they were thrown away. The `11`, on the other hand, was sent after the `.flatMap` had cleared, so that it was ready for a new value; there was an additional delay of one second before the `11` was sent, and then the `.delay` added two more seconds before the `11` reached the bottom of the pipeline.

Now let's insert a buffer:

    self.subject
        .buffer(size: 4, prefetch: .keepFull, whenFull: .dropNewest)
        .flatMap(maxPublishers:.max(1)) {
            Just($0).delay(for: 2, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
        }
        .sink { print($0) }.store(in: &self.storage)
    for i in 1...10 {
        self.subject.send(i)
    }
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) {
        self.subject.send(11)
    }

Now the output is:

    1 (after two seconds)
    2 (after two more seconds)
    3 (after two more seconds)
    4 (after two more seconds)
    5 (after two more seconds)
    11 (after two more seconds)

The buffer saved the `2` through `5` for us. At that point it was full; it is set to `.dropNewest`, so the `6` through `10` were thrown away. When the `.flatMap` asked for a new value, there was the `2` sitting in the buffer! So the `.flatMap` queued that up in the `.delay`, and meanwhile the buffer now had an opening, so when the `11` arrived, it got stored in the buffer and was eventually delivered.

So the buffer prevented at least some of the values from being lost — and of course, if the buffer were larger, it could have prevented _any_ values from being lost. Not only that, but it evened out the timing! In effect it acted as a completely new source of values, so that every two seconds, when the `.delay` ended and the `.flatMap` requested a new value, there was in fact a new value ready to hand.
